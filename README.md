# Intermittent-Time-Series-Forecasting

### Introduction
This project, authored by Varsha Balaji, focuses on the specialized domain of Intermittent Time Series Forecasting. It explores various aspects and challenges associated with this type of forecasting, particularly in the context of "lumpy data," which presents unique challenges compared to traditional time series data.

#### Chapters Overview
Chapter 1: Intermittent Time Series Forecasting
1.1 Understanding Time Series Forecasting and Intermittent forecasting: This section introduces the concept of time series forecasting and distinguishes between intermittent forecasting and more conventional approaches.
1.2 Lumpy Data: The Challenge: An exploration of the characteristics of 'lumpy data' and the complexities it introduces in forecasting.
1.3 Traditional vs Intermittent Time Series Forecasting: A comparative analysis between traditional time series forecasting methods and those suited for intermittent time series.
1.4 Intermittent Time Series Forecasting Approaches - Statistical Method: Discussion of statistical methods specifically tailored for intermittent time series forecasting.
[Further sections would be listed in a similar manner, providing a brief description of each]

#### Project Structure
This Jupyter Notebook is structured in a logical flow, starting from the basic concepts of time series forecasting, progressing through the specific challenges of intermittent forecasting, and exploring various approaches and methodologies.

#### Usage
To get the most out of this project, it is recommended to follow the chapters in order. Each section builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive understanding of Intermittent Time Series Forecasting
